The application allows the user have a program create an auto generated password based the users choices of characters and length.

The appilication works with a series of questions that are asked by functions programmed in the javascripts.

The questions are the result of the functions with confirmations and prompts of whether the user as specific inputs for thier password.

Each answer adds a value that will be entered into a loop that generates the password.
